Project Plan
============

Write a simple program that takes a user specified input file
containing NIFFTE events and plots the data points in a 3D graph via
GUI.

User should be able to cycle through events and/or skip ahead to an
event as well as change coordinate systems - index coordinates or
cartesian coordinates.
